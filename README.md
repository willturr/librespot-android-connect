:warning: **Developed to help me understand interoperability (and learn some rust). App is Work In Progress and not very pretty**

A Spotify Connect Receiver for Android. Upon opening the app it will begin broadcasting and will be available for connection from any Spotify
Client on the same network.

Built using [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot). There are other Android examples using [librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java),
which is now deprecated - and as everyone knows, Rust is god's gift to programmers

### todo
- proper volume control / audio stream fixes
- improve UI
- improve status communication to user
